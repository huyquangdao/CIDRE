 Development of [isoproterenol]-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of [isoproterenol] (ISO) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of [isoproterenol] ([ISO]) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). However, dP/dt in the [ISO]-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated. These data indicate that the adaptive response to [ISO] shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA. However, prolonged stimulation (8-12 days) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and [hyperplasia] within the heart.

 Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, [rigidity] was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the [alfentanil]-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Rats that received ketanserin and [alfentanil] exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that [muscle rigidity], a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced [rigidity], although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.

 Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal CO2, intravenous administration of [fentanyl] (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced [muscular rigidity] by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. Microinjection of [fentanyl] (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation.

 METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of [paracetamol]-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an [acute liver failure] and those in whom it did not. These observations speak against long-term effects of [acute liver failure]. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of [acute liver failure].

 This is important, since different controlled release formulations of [bupropion] release the active drug at different rates. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to [bupropion HCl] 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). [Bupropion HCl] was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the [convulsions] or absence of [convulsions] were recorded. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the [[convulsions]] or absence of [[convulsions]] were recorded. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of [convulsions] to 99.8% reduction at 240 min.

 Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase-related pathways after multiple and single [METH] injections. There were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in MEK1, Erk2p, GSK3alpha, 14-3-3e, and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of [METH]. MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of [METH], but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of [METH]. MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of [[METH]], but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of [[METH]].

 Therapeutic drug monitoring of [tobramycin]: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of [tobramicyn] on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. [tobramycin] (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of [tobramycin] and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. [Tobramycin] serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. In TD group, three patients developed [decreased auditory function], of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented [decreased auditory function]. In TD group, three patients developed [decreased auditory function], of which one presented with an [auditory loss] of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented [decreased auditory function].

 This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre-induced by [doxorubicin] in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of [doxorubicin] (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg). Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either [doxorubicin] (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional [doxorubicin] treatment. On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of [cardiomyopathy]. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on [doxorubicin]-induced cardiotoxicity in dogs.

Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of [fasciculation] were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The results indicate that [muscle fasciculation] was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of [muscle fasciculation] than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). The results indicate that [[muscle fasciculation]] was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of [[muscle fasciculation]] than those in Group PS (p < 0.001).

 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including [akathisia], with quetiapine in patients with bipolar mania. Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy (up to 800 mg/day) (n = 209) versus placebo (n = 198), with lithium or [haloperidol] monotherapy as respective active controls. RESULTS: The incidence of EPS-related adverse events, including [akathisia], was no different with quetiapine monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%). Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with [haloperidol] (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS. The incidence of [akathisia] was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with QTP + Li/DVP (3.6%) and PBO + Li/DVP (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In bipolar mania, the incidence of EPS, including [akathisia], with quetiapine therapy is similar to that with placebo.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify specific clinical predictors of [reduction in renal function] in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. [Decreased renal function] was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, [diuretic], and beta-blocker therapy. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of [decreased renal function] than controls (P =.003). Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing [decreased renal function] in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). A lower risk of [renal impairment] was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96). CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of [decreased renal function] in patients with CHF. [Diuretic] use and advanced age increased this risk. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of [renal impairment] in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group.

Whereas 33.3% of the patients with [CIN] were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of [CIN] related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014). Whereas 33.3% of the patients with [[CIN]] were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of [[CIN]] related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014). Among the 15 patients with [CIN], 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, [CIN] is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although [CIN] usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

 Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with [ethambutol]-induced optic neuropathy. PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal degeneration in [ethambutol]-induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography (OCT). [Ethambutol] is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis. A serious complication of [ethambutol] is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. In both sets (four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent [visual deficits] (patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with [EMB]-induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. Additionally, in terms of management of [EMB]-induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.

 [Ethambutol] is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis. However, early on, when the toxic [optic neuropathy] is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss. This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo-cellular axons (or small-caliber axons) within the papillo-macular bundle in toxic or hereditary [optic neuropathies]. OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of [optic neuropathies].

 Effects of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular [thrombotic] events in patients with arthritis. There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular [thrombotic] events may be higher with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The incidence of cardiovascular [thrombotic] events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial [thrombotic]) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration. The incidence of cardiovascular [[thrombotic]] events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial [[thrombotic]]) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration. The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) [aspirin] (n = 1051) and nonusers of [aspirin] (n = 6883). The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) [[aspirin]] (n = 1051) and nonusers of [[aspirin]] (n = 6883). Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of [thrombotic] events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo. The risk of serious [thrombotic] events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose. The rates of events in users of [aspirin] were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses. Short- and intermediate-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) valdecoxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of [thrombotic] events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials.

 BACKGROUND: [Hypotension] and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) [NTG] immediately after learning, 3) [NTG] 3 h after learning, 4) [NTG] and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) [[NTG]] immediately after learning, 3) [[NTG]] 3 h after learning, 4) [[NTG]] and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone.

The extent of [hypotension] and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of [NTG] (n = 3) and [NTG] + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of [[NTG]] (n = 3) and [[NTG]] + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the [NTG] group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the [NTG] + NIMO groups, respectively. PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the [[NTG]] group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the [[NTG]] + NIMO groups, respectively. The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during [hypotension], because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.

 A catch in the [Reye]. Twenty-six cases of [Reye syndrome] from The Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Australia, occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed. Of these, 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of [Reye syndrome]. [Aspirin] or salicylate ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases (5%), and paracetamol (acetaminophen) had been administered in only six of the cases (30%). Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of [Reye syndrome] was accomplished in 90% of the cases. The incidence of [Reye syndrome] in New South Wales, Australia, is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain. The mortality for these [Reye syndrome] cases in Australia was 45% as compared with a 32% case-fatality rate in the United States. In Australia, the pediatric usage of [aspirin] has been extremely low for the past 25 years (less than 1% of total dosage units sold), with paracetamol (acetaminophen) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market.

 Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department [seizure] patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department [seizure] patients. METHODS: This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible [seizure] patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation. Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite [benzoylecgonine] using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology. Plasma samples with [benzoylecgonine] greater than 150 ng/mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng/mL were defined as positive. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related [seizure] disorder, estimated time from [seizure] to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related [[seizure]] disorder, estimated time from [[seizure]] to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for [benzoylecgonine] and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for amphetamine. CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult [seizure] patients had a low yield.

 Pain responses in [methadone]-maintained opioid abusers. This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in [methadone]-maintenance (MM) treatment (n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects (n = 60). These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a [pain-intolerant] subset of clinical patients.

 RESULTS: Following intravenous [PAN] urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four. Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak [proteinuria] and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards).

 Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen-induced rat [pituitary tumors] may mediate estrogen-initiated tumor angiogenesis. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] ([E2]) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the [E2] exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. After 15 days of [E2] exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of [E2] exposure.

We characterized [tacrolimus] side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug, and outcomes after conversion. Of 388 liver recipients who received [tacrolimus] as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to CyA. We recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, [tacrolimus] dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion. Of 388 liver recipients who received [[tacrolimus]] as primary immunosuppression, 70 required conversion to CyA. We recorded indication for conversion, whether conversion was early or late after transplantation, [[tacrolimus]] dose and trough blood level at conversion, and incidence of rejection after conversion. Indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity (20), [(insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus] (IDDM) (5), nephrotoxicity (3), gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (6), and cardiomyopathy (1), and for late conversion were neurotoxicity (15), IDDM (12), nephrotoxicity (3), GI toxicity (5), hepatotoxicity (6), post-transplant lmphoproliferate disease (PTLD) (2), cardiomyopathy (1), hemolytic anemia (1), and pruritus (1).

When [tacrolimus] side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction, conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely, with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long-term outcome.

 We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with [piperacillin sodium] in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and [piperacillin]-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and [piperacillin]-treated patients. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and [[piperacillin]]-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and [[piperacillin]]-treated patients. The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and [piperacillin]- vs tobramycin and [piperacillin]-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115).

A single dose of valproic acid (VPA), which is a widely used antiepileptic drug, is associated with oxidative stress in rats, as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of [15-F(2t)-isoprostane] ([15-F(2t)-IsoP]). To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA-associated oxidative stress and [hepatotoxicity], adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of [15-F(2t)-IsoP], lipid hydroperoxides (LPO), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs). Plasma and liver [15-F(2t)-IsoP] were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of VPA treatment compared to control. [Liver toxicity] was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology. Serum alpha-GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4, which corresponded to [hepatotoxicity] as shown by the increasing incidence of inflammation of the liver capsule, necrosis, and steatosis throughout the study. Overall, these findings indicate that VPA treatment results in oxidative stress, as measured by levels of [15-F(2t)-IsoP], which precedes the onset of necrosis, steatosis, and elevated levels of serum alpha-GST.

 The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated [interferon] and ribavirin. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting [hemolytic anemia]. Viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of [hemolytic anemia] in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting [hemolytic anemia]. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of [ribavirin]-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. Although [ribavirin]-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage [ribavirin]-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.

 Management strategies for ribavirin-induced [hemolytic anemia] in the treatment of hepatitis C: clinical and economic implications. OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/ribavirin compared with [interferon-alpha] monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin-induced [hemolytic anemia] (RIHA). Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin-induced [hemolytic anemia] ([RIHA]). The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of [RIHA] during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of [RIHA]. Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating [RIHA]. RESULTS: [RIHA], defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. The standard of care for management of [RIHA] is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage. We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant [RIHA] to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692). CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant [RIHA] is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs. Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of [RIHA] in a real-world population. Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating [RIHA] provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.

 Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine [catatonia] in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals. The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced [catatonia] in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of [catatonia] (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas [melatonin] potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, [melatonin] did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by [melatonin]. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine [catatonia] rather than directly on the pituitary.

 In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled [prostaglandin (PG) E2] facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure. Intra-arterially given [PGE2] produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle. The effect of intra-arterial [PGE2] could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial [PGE2] was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically. The effect of intra-arterial [[PGE2]] could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial [[PGE2]] was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically. The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial [PGE2], given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor. However, when given intravesically, [PGE2] may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium. Prostanoids may, via release of tachykinins, contribute to both urge and [bladder hyperactivity] seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract.

DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced [atrial tachyarrhythmia] ([SIAT]) is a rare phenomenon. Fewer than 50 cases of [SIAT] have been described in the literature. This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to [SIAT]. It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of [SIAT], and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like [salbutamol] (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of [postoperative delirium].

[Postoperative delirium] was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery. The prevalence of [postoperative delirium] was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11/57 [19%] vs 23/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation. Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing [postoperative delirium] in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted.

 Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of [seizures] at the cellular level.

We compared these results with those previously obtained with [kainic acid] (KA), a potent glutamate agonist. We compared these results with those previously obtained with [kainic acid] ([KA]), a potent glutamate agonist. Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop [seizures] at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity. Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for [seizures] induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine.

 Effects of [cisapride] on symptoms and postcibal small-bowel motor function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of [abdominal pain] and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility. Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, [cisapride], on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation-predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [[cisapride], 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)]. RESULTS: In diarrhoea-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the [cisapride] and placebo groups. In [cisapride]-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo.

BACKGROUND: [Unfractionated heparin sodium] ([UFH]) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to [UFH] (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of [UFH] was changed according to the activated clotting time level. [HIT] antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were [HIT] antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable.

 Acute renal toxicity of [doxorubicin] (adriamycin)-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Acute renal toxicity of [doxorubicin] ([adriamycin])-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Acute [doxorubicin]-loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free [doxorubicin] (DX) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free [doxorubicin] ([DX]) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or [DX]NP survived. Free NP did not provoke any [proteinuria]. Two hr post-injection, [DX]NP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free [DX] (p < 0.025). In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 rats given [DX] died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by [DX]NP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, [DX]NP killed less animals than free [DX], despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former.

 Various data suggest that male patients who have received [digoxin] on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of [digoxin] therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of [digoxin] on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH. This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of [[digoxin]] therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of [[digoxin]] on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The patients of the study and control group (without [digoxin]) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients. The findings support the reports concerning [digoxin] effect on plasma estradiol, testosterone, and LH. Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant [decrease in sexual desire], sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.

 Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-[nephrotic] stage (day 1-5) and [nephrotic] stage (day 6-11). Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-[[nephrotic]] stage (day 1-5) and [[nephrotic]] stage (day 6-11). In pre-[nephrotic] stage the plasma level of fatty acids, triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant. At the beginning of [nephrotic] stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days. In the pre-[nephrotic] stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early [nephrotic] stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. In the pre-[[nephrotic]] stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early [[nephrotic]] stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. These observations indicate that [puromycin aminonucleoside] alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL. It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in [nephrotic] rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism.

 Thyroid function and urine-concentrating ability during [lithium] treatment. We measured serum thyroxine and urine-concentrating ability (Umax) in response to desmopressin (DDAVP) in 85 patients receiving [lithium]. Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and [hypothyroid] patients while some [hypothyroid] patients concentrated their urine well.

 Orthostatic hypotension occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic prazosin-pretreated conscious spontaneously [hypertensive] rats. 1. Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously [hypertensive] rats (SHR). The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist [cirazoline] (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment.

 1. Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic [prazosin] treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of [prazosin] (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). [Orthostatic hypotension] was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by [prazosin] (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with [prazosin] at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic [prazosin] treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic [prazosin] treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic [prazosin] pretreatment. Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic [prazosin] treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic [prazosin] treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic [prazosin] treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

 [22-oxacalcitriol] suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure. A new vitamin D analogue, [22-oxacalcitriol] (OCT), has been shown to have promising characteristics. A new vitamin D analogue, [22-oxacalcitriol] ([OCT]), has been shown to have promising characteristics. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of [OCT] on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function. Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of [OCT] (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after [OCT] or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, [OCT] significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency. In long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, [OCT] (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. These effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and [hyperphosphatemia]. In animals with normal renal function, [OCT] induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses. In Nx dogs, [OCT] reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. In addition, [OCT] improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though [OCT] does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.

 Long-term efficacy and toxicity of high-dose [amiodarone] therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. [Amiodarone] was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with [amiodarone] and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing [amiodarone] at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug.

 Effect of calcium chloride and 4-aminopyridine therapy on [desipramine] toxicity in rats. BACKGROUND: [Hypotension] is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose. This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced [hypotension]. In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant [desipramine] IP followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline. RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed [hypotension] and QRS prolongation. CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced [hypotension] in rats. These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced [hypotension].

 Phase I trial of [13-cis-retinoic acid] in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation. PURPOSE: Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with [13-cis-retinoic acid] (cis-RA) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation. PURPOSE: Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with [13-cis-retinoic acid] ([cis-RA]) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation. Since [cis-RA] has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients, it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy. This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal-tolerated dosage (MTD), toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of [cis-RA] administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one assessable patients, 2 to 12 years of age, were treated with oral [cis-RA] administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 courses. RESULTS: The MTD of [cis-RA] was 160 mg/m2/d. Dose-limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg/m2/d included hypercalcemia (n = 3), [rash] (n = 2), and anemia/thrombocytopenia/emesis/[rash] (n = 1).

 Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate-induced [narcosis] in rats. Melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced [narcosis]. [Sodium thiopenthal] was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with melatonin (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg). Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate [narcosis], however, no dose-effect correlation was found. In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate [narcosis]. In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of [narcosis], and a reduction in mortality rate. Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced [narcosis]. Thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological [narcosis] seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.

Patients began [thalidomide] at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54. [Somnolence] and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of [thalidomide] in renal cell carcinoma. The dose-response relationship, if any, of [thalidomide] for renal cell carcinoma is unclear.

 Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during nitric oxide-induced [headache] in patients with chronic tension-type [headache]. It has been proposed that nitric oxide (NO) induced [headache] in primary [headache]s may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve (AUCCGRP) on [GTN] vs. placebo day in either patients (P=0.65) or controls (P=0.48). The AUCCGRP recorded on the [GTN] day did not differ between patients and controls (P=0.36). Both in patients and controls, CGRP levels changed significantly over time, on both the [GTN] and placebo days (P < 0.05). The present study indicates that NO-induced immediate [headache] is not associated with release of CGRP.

 Myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during [dobutamine] stress echocardiography. [Dobutamine] stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia. The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by [dobutamine]. We performed DSE on 51 patients with [coronary spastic angina] but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ([variant angina]). DSE was performed with intravenous [dobutamine] infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min every 5 minutes.

 Risk for valvular heart disease among users of [fenfluramine] and dex[fenfluramine] who underwent echocardiography before use of medication. BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of [fenfluramine] and dex[fenfluramine] had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of [fenfluramine] or dex[fenfluramine] who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications. DESIGN: Cohort study. PATIENTS: 46 patients who used [fenfluramine] or dex[fenfluramine] for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy. The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either [aortic or mitral regurgitation] by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation). The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either [aortic or mitral regurgitation] by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild [aortic regurgitation] or moderate mitral regurgitation). RESULTS: Two patients (4.3% [95% CI, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving [fenfluramine]-phentermine developed valvular heart disease. One had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild [aortic regurgitation] that progressed to moderate regurgitation. The second patient developed new moderate [aortic insufficiency].

 BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over [cisplatin] (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over [cisplatin] ([CDDP]) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to [peripheral nervous system damage]. RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent [peripheral neurotoxicity]. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by [CDDP], mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by [CDDP] that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

 Iatrogenic risks of [endometrial carcinoma] after treatment for breast cancer in a large French case-control study. Since [tamoxifen] is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined. Cases of [endometrial cancer] diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of [tamoxifen] received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for [tamoxifen] users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who receive [tamoxifen] for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment. A long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of [tamoxifen] as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted.

 BACKGROUND: Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of [tamoxifen]. Review of the literature reveals an association between [tamoxifen] use and gynecologic tumors. CASE: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman was treated with [tamoxifen] for stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma. Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of [tamoxifen] use. After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases, the patient was found to have a stage Ic [granulosa cell tumor of the ovary]. CONCLUSION: Patients with [tamoxifen]-induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in [tamoxifen] metabolism.

 It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with [mitomycin C] treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent.

 [Nephrotoxic] effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography. BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in [nephropathy]. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less [nephrotoxic] than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the [iohexol] group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with [iohexol], -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the [[iohexol]] group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with [[iohexol]], -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the [iohexol] group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the [iohexol] group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the [iohexol] group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the [iohexol] group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the [[iohexol]] group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the [[iohexol]] group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: [Nephropathy] induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.

 [Neuroleptic malignant syndrome] is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. [Risperidone], a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic, has high serotonin 5-HT2 receptor blockade and dose-related D2 receptor blockade. The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with [risperidone] at low dosages. With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms, it was thought the frequency of [neuroleptic malignant syndrome] might also be lowered. The syndrome reversed after discontinuing [risperidone] and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine.

 Thus, [caffeine] (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. Borderline [hypertensive] men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg. Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of [hypertension] and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg. Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from [caffeine] in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits. [Caffeine]-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). We suspect that the potential for [caffeine] to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.

 Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on L-dopa-induced [dyskinesias] in MPTP-treated monkeys. They were then treated chronically with [L-DOPA/benserazide] 50/12.5 mg/kg given orally daily for 2 months. This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect, but all animals manifested [dyskinesia]. A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the [dyskinetic] movements would be modified. Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the [dyskinetic] movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology. However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the [dyskinetic] movements. Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of [dyskinesia].

 Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and deoxycorticosterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against [pilocarpine]-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice. Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against [pilocarpine] seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity. However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and [status epilepticus] was obtained.

Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and [status epilepticus] (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by [kainic acid] (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures.

Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, [zidovudine] and placebo. Twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and [zidovudine] groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15). The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and [zidovudine] groups, respectively (p > 0.36). For patients with prior [zidovudine] therapy, the mean change in CD4 cells in the combination and [zidovudine] groups was 63.7 cells/mm3 and 4.9 cells/mm3 at week 8 and 6.8 cells/mm3 and -45.1 cells/mm3 at week 16, respectively.

Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor [N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid] ([CB 3717]). [CB 3717], N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. [CB 3717], [N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid], is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of [CB 3717] polyglutamates. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H][CB 3717], 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as [CB 3717] tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H][[CB 3717]], 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as [[CB 3717]] tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, [CB 3717] di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than [CB 3717], respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of [CB 3717] cytotoxicity. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, [[CB 3717]] di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than [[CB 3717]], respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of [[CB 3717]] cytotoxicity. In early clinical studies with [CB 3717], activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting [nephrotoxicity]. This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of [CB 3717] under acidic conditions. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of [CB 3717] administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in [nephrotoxicity] may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients.

 METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of [IFS]. [Cystitis] was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis. RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by [IFS] by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively. In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by [IFS]. However, the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent [HC].

 Behavioral effects of MK-801 on [reserpine]-treated mice. The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by [reserpine] treatments. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by [reserpine]. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. These results show that [reserpine] produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs. The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and [tremor] according to the employed model.

 Behavioral effects of MK-801 on [reserpine]-treated mice. The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by [reserpine] treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson's disease, or [tardive dyskinesia], and its response after glutamatergic blockage. [Reserpine] also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's disease. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by [reserpine].

 RESULTS: [Prostigmine]-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the [prostigmine]-morphine-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and T1/2 over the LP: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine-induced [sphincter of Oddi spasm] in humans.

Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid-treated groups (-50 and -79% in [[M]] and T, respectively). [M]aximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the [M] group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with [M], whereas tetanic tensions were similar. ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber [atrophy] in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa [atrophy] with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis. ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber [[atrophy]] in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa [[atrophy]] with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis. Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T, and PF), showed that [muscle atrophy] was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T-treated animals. We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb [atrophy], resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb [atrophy] was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.

This was associated with a similar [loss in body weight]. [M]aximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the [M] group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with [M], whereas tetanic tensions were similar.

We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb [atrophy], resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb [atrophy] was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.

A phase I clinical study of the antipurine antifolate [lometrexol] ([DDATHF]) given with oral folic acid. [Lometrexol] is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis. Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that [lometrexol] has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate. However, the initial clinical development of [lometrexol] was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of [lometrexol] can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of [lometrexol] given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of [lometrexol] can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation.

 We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of [adriamycin] (ADR). We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of [adriamycin] ([ADR]). Rats were stratified into control groups and [ADR]-induced nephropathy groups. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with [ADR] revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation. They also had significantly higher levels of [proteinuria] compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05). Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the [ADR]-nephropathy group (P < 0.05). In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the [ADR]-nephropathy group. However, in the [ADR]-nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas. CONCLUSION: We suggest that interactions between NO and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the [ADR]-induced nephrosis.

Additionally, 20 to 25% of [paracetamol]-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following [paracetamol] feeding. An electron microscope study of the livers of [paracetamol]-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens.

 Erythropoietin restores the [anemia]-induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumors. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of [anemia] prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors. Four days after [carboplatin] treatment, tumors (DS-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. Neither [carboplatin] nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se. In the [anemia] group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). In the group where [anemia] was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced [anemia] reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas correction of [anemia] by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.

 Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced [psychosis] during overt continuous verbal fluency. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist [ketamine] leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, [ketamine] exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. [Ketamine]-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and [ketamine] for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. [Ketamine] led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency.

 OBJECTIVE: [Diabetic nephropathy] is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against [diabetic nephropathy]. RESULTS: The glomeruli of human [diabetic nephropathy] patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating [streptozotocin]-induced renal damage. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against [diabetic nephropathy] is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production.

 BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative [convulsive] seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative [convulsive] [seizures] from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose [tranexamic acid] (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose [tranexamic acid] ([TXA]) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative [seizures]. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but [seizures] were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. All patients with [seizures] did not have permanent neurological abnormalities. No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their [seizures] was apparent.

 Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of difluoromethylornithine and [sulindac] for prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas. A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) plus [sulindac] or matched placebos. Temporary [hearing loss] is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO, thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms. Based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus [sulindac] compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 dB; P = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies. There were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the DFMO plus [sulindac] group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (P = 0.02). There is a <2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with DFMO plus [sulindac] compared with those treated with placebo.

 At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with [testosterone] (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with [testosterone] ([T], 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, [irritability], copulation, partner preference, and aggression. Behavioral measures included locomotion, [irritability], copulation, partner preference, and [aggression]. Animals were tested for [aggression] in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch). Chronic [T] treatment significantly decreased 5-H[T] and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased [irritability] but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased [irritability] but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or [aggression]. [T]he most striking effect of combining [T]+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT may be especially prone to exhibit [aggressive behavior].

 Intracavitary chemotherapy ([paclitaxel]/carboplatin liquid crystalline cubic phases) for recurrent glioblastoma -- clinical observations. For human glioblastoma recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of [paclitaxel] and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study. A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of [paclitaxel] and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages. In the latter group, [brain edema] was markedly reduced and dealt medically.

 Six cases of [cauda equina syndrome] with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997. All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% [lignocaine]. The dose of hyperbaric 5% [lignocaine] administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% [lignocaine]. The dose of hyperbaric 5% [[lignocaine]] administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg.

 PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of [ocular hypertension] and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility. Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M [dexamethasone] for 12 days. RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with [dexamethasone] with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of [dexamethasone] exposure.

 Long-term [lithium] treatment and the kidney. This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term [lithium] treatment on the kidney. Creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term [lithium] for more than one year. These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to [lithium], available for most of our patients. No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during [lithium] treatment. Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-[lithium] values. [Polyuria] above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients.

 [Suprofen], a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute [flank pain] syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States. To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 [suprofen]-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome.

 The etiology of [pyeloureteritis cystica] has long been attributed to chronic infection and inflammation. The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of [heparin] therapy for suspected pelvic thrombophlebitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation.

 Long-term administration of [quinidine] was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. Liver biopsy showed active [hepatitis]. Discontinuance of [quinidine] therapy led to normalization of liver function tests. A challenge dose of [quinidine] caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic acid dehydrogenase values. This report also suggests that, even after long-term administration, the [hepatic toxicity] is reversible.

 Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen, adriamycin, carbon tetrachloride, [chloroform] and galactosamine. In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (CS) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the [hepatotoxic] effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, [chloroform]- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine [hepatotoxicity]).

 Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and [daunorubicin] but not doxorubicin. PURPOSE: The anthracyclines [daunorubicin] and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the [hematologic toxicity] following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, [daunorubicin], and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, [daunorubicin], and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from [daunorubicin] and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of [daunorubicin] activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating [hematologic toxicity].

 Delayed-onset [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia. BACKGROUND: [Heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. BACKGROUND: [Heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after [heparin] exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. Delayed recognition and treatment of [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia are delayed. PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications. MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism, results of [heparin]-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included [heparin] exposure--in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications. Thromboemboli were venous (12 patients, 7 with [pulmonary emboli]) or arterial (4 patients) or both. On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic [heparin], which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/L; mean nadir after [heparin] re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/L). On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic [[heparin]], which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/L; mean nadir after [[heparin]] re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/L). Results of serologic tests for [heparin]-induced antibodies were positive in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized. To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not [heparin], should be initiated.

METHODS: [ASA] was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats. In single dose studies, DH, MD, and [VSD] were induced on GDs 9 and 10. [VSD] also was noted following treatment on GD 11. In contrast, DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and [VSD] was noted across all dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of [VSD] in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats. Variations and malformations were similar when [ASA] was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with [ASA] given at multiple doses.

In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG, and urodynamic parameters in patients with [OAB] were examined. However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with [OAB]. In patients with [OAB] urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of [OAB] symptoms in female patients. Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate [OAB] symptoms.

 The incidence and severity of [succinylcholine]-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before [succinylcholine] (n = 32 for each). The incidence and severity of [[succinylcholine]]-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before [[succinylcholine]] (n = 32 for each). In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of [succinylcholine]-associated myalgia. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between [postoperative myalgia] and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of inflammation.

 Postoperative myalgia after [succinylcholine]: no evidence for an inflammatory origin. A common side effect associated with [succinylcholine] is postoperative myalgia. The pathogenesis of this [myalgia] is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this [myalgia]. Incidence and severity of [myalgia] did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of [myalgia] compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe [myalgia] was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant). Incidence and severity of [[myalgia]] did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of [[myalgia]] compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe [[myalgia]] was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant).

At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from [myalgia] (not significant). We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported [myalgia]; no relationship between [myalgia] and the increase of IL-6 was found. We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported [[myalgia]]; no relationship between [[myalgia]] and the increase of IL-6 was found. IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before [succinylcholine] was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of [succinylcholine]-induced postoperative myalgia. IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before [[succinylcholine]] was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of [[succinylcholine]]-induced postoperative myalgia. Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after [succinylcholine].

 Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-[amnesic] effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats. Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the [amnesic]-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. Both PREGS and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of [scopolamine]. The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of [scopolamine], suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of PREGS.

 Effect of [lithium] maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function. OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by [lithium] maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations. These were evaluated with respect to the duration of [lithium] therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid disease). PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving [lithium] maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration. OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning [lithium] therapy and at biannual follow-up. RESULTS: [Hypothyroidism] developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline. RESULTS: [Hypothyroidism] developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were [hypothyroid] at baseline. Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by [hypothyroidism] than women under 60 years of age (34.6% versus 31.9%). Magnesium levels in patients on [lithium] treatment were unchanged from baseline levels. After [lithium] treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels. Thus, [lithium] treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging.

 BACKGROUND: [Sirolimus] (formerly rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation. BACKGROUND: [Sirolimus] (formerly [rapamycin]) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation. Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of [sirolimus]. Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop [capillary leak] from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators.

MESNA was given orally on the days of treatment with [[IF]] in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of [[IF]]), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with [IF] were treated by conventional prophylactic measures (raised fluid intake and forced diuresis). In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and/or symptoms of [bladder irritation] (cystitis and pollakisuria). Our results support the view that MESNA, given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include [IF], simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium.

 The movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic [dystonia], and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit. However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the [ACTH] N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term depression at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder.

 Dexmedetomidine, acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate-induced [muscle rigidity] in the rat. Intense generalized [muscle rigidity] is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced [rigidity] has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. Each rat was then injected with [alfentanil] (ALF, 0.5 mg/kg sc). Each rat was then injected with [alfentanil] ([ALF], 0.5 mg/kg sc).

 Dynamic response of blood vessel in [acute renal failure]. Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in [gentamicin]-treated animals. The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to [gentamicin]-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium. The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in [gentamicin]-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s).

 The hemodynamics of [oxytocin] and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases.

 Incomplete [cerebral ischemia] (30 min) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries. Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of [malondialdehyde], oxypurines, and nucleosides. Plasma [malondialdehyde], which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078). Increased plasma [malondialdehyde] was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia, although in this latter group [malondialdehyde] was significantly higher. The present data indicate that the determination of [malondialdehyde], oxypurines, and nucleosides in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

In rats given 1% [[BHA]], RA co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the [[BHA]]-induced epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, all [papillomas], were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration. These findings indicate that RA acted as a co-carcinogen in the [BHA] forestomach carcinogenesis of the rat.

 Ketanserin pretreatment reverses [alfentanil]-induced muscle rigidity. Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin, a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist [alfentanil]. Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the [alfentanil]-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by [alfentanil]. Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by [alfentanil] were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving [alfentanil] alone. Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by [[alfentanil]] were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving [[alfentanil]] alone. Rats that received ketanserin and [alfentanil] exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced rigidity, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, [cardiovascular, and respiratory depression].

 Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, [rigidity] was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal [ketanserin] administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the [rigidity] produced by alfentanil.

Rats that received [[ketanserin]] and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received [[ketanserin]] alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that [muscle rigidity], a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced [rigidity], although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.

[Ketanserin-muscle rigidity]
 Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl-induced [muscular rigidity] in the rat. Whereas [muscular rigidity] is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal [CO2], intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced [muscular rigidity] by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. It is speculated that the induction of [muscular rigidity] by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.

 Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of [paracetamol]-induced acute liver failure. BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of [paracetamol]-induced acute liver failure remains unknown. AIM: To examine whether [paracetamol]-induced acute liver failure increases long-term mortality. METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of [paracetamol]-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose [paracetamol]-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of [substance abuse] among survivors of acute liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: [Paracetamol]-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality.

We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the [liver injury] led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not. CONCLUSIONS: [Paracetamol]-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality.

 Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced [psychosis] in a Japanese population. BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for [psychotic disorders] such as schizophrenia. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or [phencyclidine] was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of [psychotic disorders]. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced [psychosis] are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced [psychosis]. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced [psychosis] patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced [psychosis] patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced [psychosis] patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced [psychosis] in the Japanese population.

 Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin-induced [epileptiform activity] in anesthetized rats. Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for [epilepsy] research. In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced [epileptiform activity] in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. [urethane] and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of basal activity recording, [epileptic] focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced [epileptiform activity] periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the [epileptiform activity] and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and [epileptiform activity]).

 Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in doxorubicin [nephrosis]. Finally, we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as [superoxide] production and the 4834 base pair 'common' mtDNA deletion. Among all animals, glomerular and tubular injury were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels, mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain subunit COX-I. Injury was positively correlated with [superoxide] production and the activities of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain function and induction of [superoxide] in doxorubicin-induced renal lesions.

 Therapeutic drug monitoring of [tobramycin]: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of [tobramicyn] on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. [tobramycin] (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of [tobramycin] and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. [Tobramycin] serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of [nephrotoxicity]. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of [tobramycin] is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen.

 Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative ([SM-5887]) on normal heart and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or [SM-5887] (2.5 mg/kg). Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the [SM-5887] administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or [SM-5887] (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade [cardiotoxic] changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. On the contrary, the [SM-5887] treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy.

 Chronic effects of a novel synthetic [anthracycline] derivative (SM-5887) on normal heart and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs. This study was designed to investigate the chronic [cardiotoxic] potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade [cardiotoxic]ity pre-induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs. To examine a possibly deteriorating [cardiotoxic] effect of SM-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg). The low-grade [cardiotoxic] changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic [cardiotoxicity] and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin-induced [cardiotoxicity] in dogs.

 Neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity in the [pilocarpine] model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block [seizure]-like events following high-frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices. [PILO]-injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals, in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and, in a few cases, within presumed granule cells. In addition, [PILO] injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY-immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls. The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the [PILO] model of TLE.

 It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to [coronary occlusion] and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation. During a transient (20-s) [coronary occlusion], a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. During [dipyridamole]-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in [dipyridamole]-induced hyperemia. Thallium-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during [dipyridamole]-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03).

 BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, [osteoporosis] and dementia in older women. HT included [oestrogens], with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. Long-term [oestrogen]-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking [oestrogen]-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups.

 Passage of [mannitol] into the brain around gliomas: a potential cause of rebound phenomenon. AIM: Widespread use of [mannitol] to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon. Leakage of [mannitol] into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of [mannitol] into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients. METHODS: [Mannitol] (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding [edematous] white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. [Mannitol] concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). [Mannitol] concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, [mannitol] concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of [mannitol] were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells.

 Can [lidocaine] reduce succinylcholine induced postoperative myalgia? This study was undertaken to determine the effect of [lidocaine] pretreatment on reduction of succinylcholine-induced myalgia in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. Group PS, the control group, received normal saline and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group LS, [lidocaine] 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group PR, normal saline and rocuronium 0.6 mg x kg(-1). Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of [fasciculation] were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The results indicate that [muscle fasciculation] was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of [muscle fasciculation] than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). The results indicate that [[muscle fasciculation]] was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of [[muscle fasciculation]] than those in Group PS (p < 0.001).

 Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs [diclofenac sodium] gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II). OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and [diclofenac] in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or [diclofenac] 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated [thrombotic cardiovascular] event data. RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and [diclofenac] groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than [diclofenac] (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with [diclofenac] (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema). Etoricoxib and [diclofenac] treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with [diclofenac] 150 mg. Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.

METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of [Left Ventricular Dysfunction] (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, [diuretic], and beta-blocker therapy. By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, [diuretic] therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective.

By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and [diabetes] were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with [diabetes]. [Diabetes] was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group.

[angiotensin-left ventricular dysfunction]
 METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of [enalapril] for the treatment of CHF. There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to [enalapril] with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of [hypertension], diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, diuretic, and beta-blocker therapy. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to [enalapril] had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls (P =.003). By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and [enalapril] groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the [enalapril] group ([enalapril]: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with [enalapril]; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the [[enalapril]] group ([[enalapril]]: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with [[enalapril]]; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25).

CONCLUSIONS: [Enalapril] use caused a 33% increase in the risk of decreased renal function in patients with CHF. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the [enalapril] group compared with the placebo group.

Thus, [hyperammonemia] is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with liver disease. Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced [catecholamine] release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac. Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent [catecholamine] release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac. The data suggest that [hyperammonemia] exerts a calcium channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics.

Accordingly, among the 15 [CIN] patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury. Whereas 33.3% of the patients with [CIN] were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of [CIN] related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014).

Among the 15 patients with [CIN], 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, [CIN] is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although [CIN] usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

 Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol-induced [catalepsy]. Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory [amino acid] microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. Haloperidol-induced [catalepsy] was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the [catalepsy], as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. These findings suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol-induced [catalepsy] and participate in the regulation of motor activity.

Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of [Parkinson's disease] ([PD]). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of [PD] is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of [PD]. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of [PD] patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of [PD]. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced [dopamine] activity.

 Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced [catalepsy] in rats. In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced [catalepsy] in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice.

 Nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by [nitroglycerin]-induced hypotension in adult mice. BACKGROUND: Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of [cognitive dysfunction]. We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO) administered at the onset of [nitroglycerin] (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO) administered at the onset of [nitroglycerin] ([NTG])-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) [NTG] immediately after learning, 3) [NTG] 3 h after learning, 4) [NTG] and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) [[NTG]] immediately after learning, 3) [[NTG]] 3 h after learning, 4) [[NTG]] and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) [[[NTG]]] immediately after learning, 3) [[[NTG]]] 3 h after learning, 4) [[[NTG]]] and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, [NTG] + NIMO, or delayed [NTG] (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, [[NTG]] + NIMO, or delayed [[NTG]] (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of [NTG] (n = 3) and [NTG] + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of [[NTG]] (n = 3) and [[NTG]] + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the [NTG] group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the [NTG] + NIMO groups, respectively.

CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of [NTG] immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect. NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by [NTG] but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension.

Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced [cardiotoxicity]. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and [triglycerides] and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced [cardiotoxicity].

 High fat diet-fed obese rats are highly sensitive to doxorubicin-induced [cardiotoxicity]. Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is limited due to life threatening [cardiotoxicity] in patients during and posttherapy. Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin-induced [cardiotoxicity]. This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, [ATP] synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway.

We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of [ziprasidone]. Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS, atypical antipsychotic drugs like [ziprasidone] may also be a cause. The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated [ziprasidone]. This case is the earliest (second day of treatment) NMS due to [ziprasidone] reported in the literature.

 CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of [pharyngitis]. Few cases of drug-induced hiccups have been reported related to [macrolide] antimicrobials. Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other [macrolides] and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups. However, [macrolide] antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect.

 [St. Anthony's fire], then and now: a case report and historical review. A rare case of morbid vasospasm, together with striking angiographic findings, is described secondary to the ingestion of [methysergide] by a 48-year-old woman. Despite the advent of calcium channel blockers and beta-adrenergic antagonists, ergot preparations continue to play a major role in migraine therapy, so that the danger of [St. Anthony's fire] persists.

 The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline-induced [hypokalemia] was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. Six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions: 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg [oxprenolol] orally. [Oxprenolol] caused decreases of 65% and 56% of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC.

 Beta-2-adrenoceptor-mediated [hypokalemia] and its abolishment by oxprenolol. The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline-induced [hypokalemia] was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such [hypokalemia], together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs. In the 7-hour period after terbutaline administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma [potassium] levels and drug concentrations. The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and [potassium] effects. In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment, the [hypokalemia] was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.

 Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in [hypotensive] effect of methyldopa. Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a [hypotensive] response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord. Further, [5,7-DHT] lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection. It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced [hypotension] via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.

 Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by [tacrolimus] in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report. [Tacrolimus] is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by [tacrolimus] after heart transplantation. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial [edema] and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood [tacrolimus] concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, [tacrolimus] dosage was reduced. The blood [[tacrolimus]] concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, [[tacrolimus]] dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of [tacrolimus] and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that [tacrolimus] induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy. In patients receiving [tacrolimus] therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.

 Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent [corticosterone] treatment in rats. The development of [schizophrenia] may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease. We investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent [corticosterone] treatment, on behaviour in rats. Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or [corticosterone] treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress. These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by [corticosterone] treatment, on dopaminergic regulation of PPI.

 Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced [spastic paraparesis]. After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [glutamate] concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05).

 [Sodium] channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems. We generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of [sodium] channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. Measurements of [(3)H]saxitoxin (STX) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane [sodium] channels in beta2(-/-) neurons. The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in [sodium] current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane [sodium] channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of [Na](v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to [seizures], as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced [seizures], but seemed normal in other neurological tests. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to [[seizures]], as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced [[seizures]], but seemed normal in other neurological tests.

 The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen [carcinogenesis], are still unknown. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] ([E2]) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the [E2] exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. After 15 days of [E2] exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of [E2] exposure.

 Receptor mechanisms of nicotine-induced [locomotor hyperactivity] in chronic nicotine-treated rats. At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]nicotine and [3H][spiperone] binding sites in the striatum. We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H][spiperone] binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. The number of striatal [3H][spiperone] binding sites was not affected. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H][spiperone] binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal. These results suggest that chronic nicotine-treated rats develop [locomotor hyperactivity] in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.

A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and [diltiazem], an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including [diltiazem].

To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins (PGs) to [seizure] induction, the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl, picrotoxin, pentetrazol (PTZ), electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated. To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins (PGs) to [seizure] induction, the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on [convulsions] induced by flurothyl, picrotoxin, pentetrazol (PTZ), electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated. Ibuprofen, [sulindac], mefenamic acid, and low dose meclofenamic acid increased the latency-to-onset in the flurothyl and/or PTZ models; the electroshock, picrotoxin and bicuculline models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents. These results suggest that PGs are involved in the mechanism(s) underlying fluorthyl- and PTZ-induced [convulsions], but not picrotoxin-, electroshock-, or bicuculline-induced [convulsions].

 [Pheochromocytoma] unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride. OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of [pheochromocytoma] in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent [nicardipine] and verapamil treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of [pheochromocytoma]. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of [pheochromocytoma] are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride- and tiapride-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with [pheochromocytoma].

[nicardipine-Pheochromocytoma]
 CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and [tiapride] 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of [pheochromocytoma]. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of [pheochromocytoma] are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and [tiapride] therapy. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of [tiapride] and amisulpride.

[cidofovir-immunodeficiency]
 Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe [adenovirus disease] in immunocompromised children. The incidence of severe [adenovirus disease] in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe [adenovirus disease], nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe [adenovirus disease] is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and [cidofovir]. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe [adenovirus disease] in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe [adenovirus disease]. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous [cidofovir] for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed [adenovirus pneumonia]; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with [adenovirus pneumonia]. The remaining 3 children died of [adenovirus disease]. Use of [cidofovir] in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe [adenovirus disease], namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe [adenovirus disease] in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated [adenovirus disease] may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe [adenovirus disease] treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of [adenovirus infection] possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of [adenovirus disease] in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

[Ribavirin], a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. [Ribavirin] is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. [Ribavirin] is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous [ribavirin] is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous [ribavirin] is reversible mild anemia. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous [ribavirin] therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous [ribavirin] for documented severe adenovirus disease. Intravenous [ribavirin] was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. Intravenous [ribavirin] therapy was well tolerated. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with [immunodeficiency]. Although intravenous [ribavirin] was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous [ribavirin] recovered. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous [ribavirin], is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

 The incidence of severe [adenovirus disease] in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe [adenovirus disease], nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe [adenovirus disease] is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous [ribavirin] and cidofovir. [Ribavirin], a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. [Ribavirin] is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C.

[Ribavirin] is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous [ribavirin] is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous [ribavirin] is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe [adenovirus infection] has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. An additional 3 children developed [adenovirus pneumonia]; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. Intravenous [ribavirin] was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with [adenovirus pneumonia]. The remaining 3 children died of [adenovirus disease]. Intravenous [ribavirin] therapy was well tolerated. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe [adenovirus disease], namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated [adenovirus disease] may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of [adenovirus infection] possible.

 Hepatotoxicity of [amiodarone]. [Amiodarone] has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias. The use of [amiodarone] has, however, been limited due to its serious side-effects. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to [amiodarone] treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of [amiodarone] is given. A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to [[amiodarone]] treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of [[amiodarone]] is given. It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to [amiodarone] treatment, including steatosis, alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis of the liver. Patients receiving [amiodarone] should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels. Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or [hepatomegaly].

 Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced [analgesia] and catalepsy in the rat. [Naloxone] inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, rigidity and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for [naloxone] would argue against an action at a single opioid site.

 Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and [morphine]: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat. Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and [morphine] induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to [morphine], whereas pretreatment with [morphine] did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual [morphine] in the brain.

The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and [morphine], administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and [morphine], but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of [morphine].

The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and [morphine] were similar. Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to [morphine]-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to [morphine] but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine. Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to [[morphine]]-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to [[morphine]] but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine.

In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of [catatonia] (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the [amines] on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine [catatonia] rather than directly on the pituitary.

 Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine [catatonia] in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals. The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced [catatonia] in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of [catatonia] (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. Serotonin and [N-acetyl serotonin] which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine [catatonia] rather than directly on the pituitary.

 Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2-year history of [spring allergic rhinitis], confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens. Medications were given four times daily; the [azelastine] groups received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon; the chlorpheniramine group received 4.0 mg four times daily. Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of [azelastine] (2.0 mg twice daily) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study. Lower doses of [azelastine] were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study. Drowsiness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose [azelastine] group.

 Prostaglandin E2-induced [bladder hyperactivity] in normal, conscious rats: involvement of tachykinins? The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist [RP 67,580] and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist SR 48,968, given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors. The effect of intra-arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra-arterial [RP 67,580] or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically.

 Diuretics, [potassium] and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease. It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma [potassium] can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias. If this were so, patients with [coronary artery disease] might be especially susceptible. Plasma [potassium] concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. The above results indicate that because [potassium]-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma [potassium] concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients. The above results indicate that because [[potassium]]-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma [[potassium]] concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.

[potassium-coronary artery disease]
 Diuretics, [potassium] and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease. It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma [potassium] can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a [potassium]-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a [potassium]-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a [[potassium]]-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a [[potassium]]-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. Plasma [potassium] concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of [ventricular ectopic beats] (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. The above results indicate that because [potassium]-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma [potassium] concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients. The above results indicate that because [[potassium]]-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma [[potassium]] concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.

 Coenzyme Q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin [nephrotoxicity] in mice. Coenzyme Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and [platinum] ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration. Also, histopathological [renal tissue damage] mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme Q10 treatment. It was concluded that coenzyme Q10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin [nephrotoxicity] commonly encountered in clinical practice.

 Metformin prevents experimental [gentamicin]-induced nephropathy by a mitochondria-dependent pathway. The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent [vascular dysfunction] even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of [gentamicin] toxicity. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after [gentamicin] administration. Metformin treatment fully blocked [gentamicin]-mediated acute renal failure. Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after [gentamicin] administration. We found that [gentamicin] treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen [gentamicin] nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.

 [Metformin] prevents experimental gentamicin-induced nephropathy by a mitochondria-dependent pathway. The antidiabetic drug [metformin] can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin [toxicity]. [Metformin] treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure. [Metformin] also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by [metformin] were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by [metformin]. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of [metformin] can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.

 [Spironolactone]: is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin B-related hypokalemia in cancer patients? OBJECTIVE: [Nephrotoxicity] is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B (AmB), often limiting administration of full dosage. Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB. Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB. This study was designed to assess the ability of [spironolactone] to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment. METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral [spironolactone] 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection. RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant AmB and [spironolactone] had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.0027). Those patients receiving AmB and [spironolactone] required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and [spironolactone] than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: This study showed that [spironolactone] can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.

 Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with prolactinomas may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either [delayed puberty] or short stature. We report the successful treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia with [cabergoline] in youth. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia treated with [cabergoline]. RESULTS: Four males (age 6-11 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) bipolar disorder or psychoses, with risperidone-induced elevations in serum prolactin levels (57.5-129 ng/mL, normal 5-15 ng/mL), were treated with [cabergoline] (mean dose 2.13 +/- 0.09 mg/week). When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects (mean 11.2 +/- 10.9 ng/mL), the [cabergoline] dose was reduced to 1 mg/week in three of four subjects. The mean duration of therapy with [cabergoline] was 523.5 +/- 129.7 days, and the mean duration of therapy with risperidone was 788.5 +/- 162.5 days. [Cabergoline] was well tolerated without adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: [Cabergoline] may be useful for the treatment of risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia in youth; however, further research is needed.

 Conversion to [rapamycin] immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients: report of an initial experience. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of [RAPA] conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose [rapamycin] (RAPA) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose [rapamycin] ([RAPA]) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), [posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder] (PTLD) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), [posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder] ([PTLD]) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. No relapse of [PTLD] was observed. Five patients developed pneumonia (two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal [PTLD] lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. [RAPA] levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: [RAPA] conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal.

 Conversion to [rapamycin] immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients: report of an initial experience. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of [RAPA] conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose [rapamycin] (RAPA) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose [rapamycin] ([RAPA]) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. Five patients developed [pneumonia] (two Pneumocystis carinii [pneumonia], one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. [RAPA] levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: [RAPA] conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal. However, when converting patients to [RAPA] drug levels should be monitored to avoid over-immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given.

 The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), [posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder] (PTLD) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), [posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder] ([PTLD]) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum [creatinine] [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months]. No relapse of [PTLD] was observed. Five patients developed pneumonia (two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal [PTLD] lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, [PTLD] in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one.

Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have [lithium]-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and [lithium] therapy had been discontinued. Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have [[lithium]]-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and [[lithium]] therapy had been discontinued. He remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of [lithium] and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion, with clear evidence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. [Lithium] induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped. [Lithium] induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after [lithium] was stopped. We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with [lithium]-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

 Loss of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA-containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following pilocarpine-induced [seizures]. In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to [seizure]-induced damage in a model of chronic [seizure]s. Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine, and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine-induced [seizures]. Additional neuronanatomical studies, including [cresyl violet] staining, neuronal degeneration methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels. The results indicate that, in this model, a subpopulation of GAD mRNA-containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to [seizure]-induced damage.

 Protective effect of misoprostol on [indomethacin] induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with [indomethacin]. METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either [indomethacin], 150 mg/day (Group A), or [indomethacin] 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B). METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either [[indomethacin]], 150 mg/day (Group A), or [[indomethacin]] 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B). Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of [pain]. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing [indomethacin] related renal dysfunction. Addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting [pain] control.

Heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia] ([HIT]) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. The frequencies of [HIT] after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody ([HIT] antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. The frequencies of [[HIT]] after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody ([[HIT]] antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. [HIT] antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were [HIT] antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. The percentage of [HIT] antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14. None of the subjects/patients developed UFH-related [HIT]. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the occurrence of [HIT] after liver transplantation was uncommon.

The objective of this study was to assess minor neurological dysfunction, cognitive development, and somatic development after [dexamethasone] therapy in very-low-birthweight infants. Thirty-three children after [dexamethasone] treatment were matched to 33 children without [dexamethasone] treatment. Thirty-three children after [[dexamethasone]] treatment were matched to 33 children without [[dexamethasone]] treatment. [Dexamethasone] was started between the 7th and the 28th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2.35 mg/kg/day. Exclusion criteria were asphyxia, [malformations], major surgical interventions, small for gestational age, intraventricular haemorrhage grades III and IV, periventricular leukomalacia, and severe psychomotor retardation. After [dexamethasone] treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor neurological dysfunctions. Further long-term follow-up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of [dexamethasone] on neurological and cognitive development.

 Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of [ketamine]. Effect of [ketamine] on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery. This [depression] was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the [ketamine]-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of [ketamine] injected in the SA node artery.

 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or [rauwolscine] (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and [rauwolscine] (-16%(-)-33% MAP). However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with [rauwolscine] (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). Conversely, administration of [rauwolscine] (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic prazosin treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats.

CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though OCT does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of [secondary hyperparathyroidism] because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.

 22-oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with [renal failure]. BACKGROUND: Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with [renal failure] but has several drawbacks, including hypercalcemia and/or marked suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to adynamic bone disease. The animals received supplemental [phosphate] to enhance PTH secretion. Fourteen weeks after the start of [phosphate] supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of OCT (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of [renal insufficiency].

 Long-term efficacy and toxicity of high-dose [amiodarone] therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. [Amiodarone] was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with [amiodarone] and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing [amiodarone] at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of [amiodarone] in 41% and discontinuation of [amiodarone] in 10% of patients. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of [[amiodarone]] in 41% and discontinuation of [[amiodarone]] in 10% of patients. The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were [tremor] or ataxia (35%), nausea and anorexia (8%), visual halos or blurring (6%), thyroid function abnormalities (6%) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (5%). Although large-dose [amiodarone] is highly effective in the long-term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients. However, when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects, 75% of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed with [amiodarone].

 In male Swiss mice, muscimol produced [myoclonic jerks]. Of the benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the [myoclonic jerks]. While (-)-[baclofen] (1-3 mg/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg/kg) lacked this property. Considering the fact that 5-HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical [myoclonus], the muscimol-induced [myoclonus] seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition.

 BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, [crocins], as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, [crocins] (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + [crocins] (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups. METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, [[crocins]] (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + [[crocins]] (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups. In [Alzheimer's disease] groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated. In STZ + [crocin] animal groups, [crocin] was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. In STZ + [[crocin]] animal groups, [[crocin]] was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. Prescription of [crocin] in each dose was repeated once for two days. RESULTS: It was found out that [crocin] (30 mg/kg)-treated STZ-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated STZ-injected rats. In addition, [crocin] in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ-injected group in passive avoidance test.

 Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-[calcium] concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes. Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free-[calcium] concentrations ([[Ca](2+)](i)) in isolated myocytes. The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias, decreased the time course of [ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation], reduced arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs. [[Ca](2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine. These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR. The mechanism may be related to the improvement of [Ca](2+) handling.

[Phenobarbital] (PB) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that PB-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. [Phenobarbital] ([PB]) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that [PB]-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. [Phenobarbital] ([[PB]]) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that [[PB]]-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with [PB] who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac arrest, the other of acute bronchopneumonia. At autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of [necrosis] surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue. Our findings illustrate that [PB] may be associated with chronic liver damage, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. For this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of [PB]-related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction.

 [Ethambutol]-associated optic neuropathy. INTRODUCTION: [Ethambutol] is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss. We report 3 cases which presented with [bitemporal hemianopia]. CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with [ethambutol]-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described. TREATMENT: Despite stopping [ethambutol] on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. CONCLUSIONS: [Ethambutol] usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. The author postulates that in cases of [ethambutol] associated chiasmopathy, [ethambutol] may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.

 Effects of [verapamil] on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs. BACKGROUND: [Atrial tachycardia]-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered [verapamil] to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. RESULTS: [Verapamil] caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of [verapamil]. In these experiments, [verapamil] shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by [verapamil] (n=5). In the presence of autonomic blockade, [verapamil] failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. Neither [verapamil] nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade. Epicardial mapping suggested that [verapamil] promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. CONCLUSIONS: [Verapamil] promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.

 Effects of verapamil on [atrial fibrillation] and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs. BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of [atrial fibrillation] (AF) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current. BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of [atrial fibrillation] ([AF]) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current.

There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote [[AF]], consistent with an [[AF]] promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of [AF] promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and [nadolol] was applied in some experiments. Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during [AF].

 It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of AZT into the chain in place of thymidine thus preventing the [phosphate] hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation. Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such [thrombocytopenia] showed changes compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

 Influence of diet free of NAD-precursors on acetaminophen [hepatotoxicity] in mice. The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with AAP [hepatitis] and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals. [Liver injuries] were quantified as serum activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT). While AAP caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by [nicotinic acid amide] (NAA), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD. While AAP caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by [nicotinic acid amide] ([NAA]), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD. In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of AAP, and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet, the [liver damage] was inhibited by 50% by ethanol.

 Impact of [alcohol] exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures. BACKGROUND: More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith (1973) reported on the devastation caused by [alcohol] exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged. Early identification of fetal [alcohol] exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes. This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting [alcohol]-related fetal growth impairment. METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief [alcohol] intervention study. Because intensity of [alcohol] consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) [alcohol] consumers. Because intensity of [[alcohol]] consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) [[alcohol]] consumers. Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and [drug abuse]. When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non-[alcohol]-exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns. Any [alcohol] consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers. Although the reliance on self-reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal [alcohol] effects.

 Nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead-induced [hypertension]. We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites (NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead-induced [hypertension]. This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead-induced [hypertension] is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression. Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma [malondialdehyde] (MDA), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma [malondialdehyde] ([MDA]), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. The lead-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma [MDA] concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma [MDA], or NOS expression in the control group. In conclusion, lead-induced [hypertension] in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression. This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with [hypertension].

 BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over cisplatin (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of [neurotoxic] effects. However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other [neurotoxic] drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage.

Moreover, significant amounts of [platinum] were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is [neurotoxic] in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that [neurotoxic]ity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

 Iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for [breast cancer] in a large French case-control study. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after [breast cancer] (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of [breast cancer] and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after [[breast cancer]] (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of [[breast cancer]] and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Women who had received [tamoxifen] were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of [tamoxifen] received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for [tamoxifen] users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who had endometrial cancer and had received [tamoxifen] had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with [breast cancer]. Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with [tamoxifen] have poorer prognosis.

RESULTS: [Hyperprolactinemia] was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 years. Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by [hyperprolactinemia]. Controlling for relevant covariates, we also found treatment with selective [serotonin] reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius (P = .03) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine (P < .05).

 DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and [stroke] (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, [vitamin E], and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements. Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of [stroke] were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01).

 Does supplemental [vitamin C] increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes? BACKGROUND: [Vitamin C] acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro. These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of [vitamin C] in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between [vitamin C] intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total [vitamin C] intake from food and supplements.

When dietary and supplemental [vitamin C] were analyzed separately, only supplemental [vitamin C] showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. When dietary and supplemental [[vitamin C]] were analyzed separately, only supplemental [[vitamin C]] showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. [Vitamin C] intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline. CONCLUSION: A high [vitamin C] intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes.

 METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, [iohexol]. The study involved 129 patients with [diabetes] with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the [iohexol] group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with [iohexol], -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the [[iohexol]] group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with [[iohexol]], -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the [iohexol] group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]).

From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the [[iodixanol]] group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with [[iodixanol]] minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the [iodixanol] group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the [iodixanol] group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). Two of the 64 patients in the [[iodixanol]] group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the [[iodixanol]] group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving [iodixanol] had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the [iodixanol] group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the [iodixanol] group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]).

CONCLUSIONS: Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when [iodixanol] is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.

 [Nephrotoxic] effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography. BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in [nephropathy]. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less [nephrotoxic] than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the [nephrotoxic] effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum [creatinine] concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the [creatinine] concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the [creatinine] concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the [creatinine] concentration from day 0 to day 7. Other end points were an increase in the [[creatinine]] concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the [[creatinine]] concentration from day 0 to day 7.

 Experimental cranial pain elicited by [capsaicin]: a PET study. Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in [migraine] without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval. It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the [migraine] attack itself and represents the so called '[migraine] generator'. It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the [[migraine]] attack itself and represents the so called '[[migraine]] generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the [migraine] patients. A small amount of [capsaicin] was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned [migraine] study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state.

 Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane-induced [hypotension] in humans. The effect of isoflurane-induced [hypotension] on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, [oxygen], and isoflurane. [Hypotension] was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during [hypotension]. Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when [hypotension] was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow. We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced [hypotension] and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.

 [Cefotetan]-induced immune hemolytic anemia. We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous [cefotetan].

Several structurally related metabolites of [progesterone] (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and deoxycorticosterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice.

Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and [status epilepticus] (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and [status epilepticus] was obtained. We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced seizures and [status epilepticus] in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of [status epilepticus] in humans.

Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and [deoxycorticosterone] ([3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones]) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice. Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and [status epilepticus] (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and [status epilepticus] was obtained. We conclude that neuroactive steroids are highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced seizures and [status epilepticus] in mice, and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of [status epilepticus] in humans.

 Behavioral effects of MK-801 on [reserpine]-treated mice. The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by [reserpine] treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for [Parkinson's disease], or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by [reserpine]. However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in [reserpine]-treated mice. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. On the other hand, [reserpine] induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by [reserpine]. Pretreatment with [reserpine] (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of [reserpine].

Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T, and PF), showed that [muscle atrophy] was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T-treated animals. We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb [atrophy], resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb [atrophy] was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.

[purine-Thrombocytopenia]
 Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo [purine] synthesis. However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative [toxicities]. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the [toxicity] of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the [toxicity] of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major [toxicities]. There was no clear relationship between clinical [toxicity] and the extent of plasma folate elevation. Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce [toxicity] by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance.

 Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in puromycin aminonucleoside-induced [nephrotic syndrome] in rats. [Nephrotic syndrome] is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema. In contrast, the protein abundances of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-K(+)-2[Cl](-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-[Cl](-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased. In contrast, the protein abundances of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 3 (NHE3), Na(+)-K(+)-2[[Cl]](-) cotransporter (BSC-1), and thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-[[Cl]](-) cotransporter (TSC) were decreased. In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN-induced [nephrotic syndrome].

[Cl-nephrotic syndrome]
 Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in [puromycin aminonucleoside]-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats. Nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized [edema]. An experimental group of rats was treated with [puromycin aminonucleoside] (PAN; 180 mg/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle. An experimental group of rats was treated with [puromycin aminonucleoside] ([PAN]; 180 mg/kg iv), whereas the control group received only vehicle. After 7 days, [PAN] treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites. Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of [PAN]-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-ENaC subunits. In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with [PAN]-induced nephrotic syndrome.

 Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in puromycin aminonucleoside-induced [nephrotic syndrome] in rats. However, the molecular basis for the decreased renal [sodium] excretion remains undefined. We hypothesized that epithelial [Na] channel (E[Na]C) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium retention. We hypothesized that epithelial [Na] channel (E[Na]C) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased [sodium] retention.

 Does hormone therapy for the treatment of [breast cancer] have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition? This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for [breast cancer] affects cognition. Patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole, tamoxifen alone or combined (ATAC) (n=94) and a group of women without [breast cancer] (n=35) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures. The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of [breast cancer].

We have studied the role of [NO] and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin (ADR). METHODS: The alteration in the [NO] pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) system. Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR-induced [nephropathy] groups. These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving aminoguanidine (AG) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-[NO] synthase. Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR-[nephropathy] group (P < 0.05).

To begin addressing this need, we characterized [UMB24] (1-(2-phenethyl)-4-(2-pyridyl)-piperazine) and (+/-)-SM 21 (3alpha-tropanyl-2-(4-chorophenoxy)butyrate) in receptor binding and behavioral studies. To begin addressing this need, we characterized [UMB24] ([1-(2-phenethyl)-4-(2-pyridyl)-piperazine]) and (+/-)-SM 21 (3alpha-tropanyl-2-(4-chorophenoxy)butyrate) in receptor binding and behavioral studies. Receptor binding studies confirmed that [UMB24] and (+/-)-SM 21 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors. When administered alone, (+/-)-SM 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline, but [UMB24] had locomotor depressant actions.

 BACKGROUND: [Pain] on injection of propofol is unpleasant. METHODS: A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline (control) or [remifentanil] to a target Ce of 2 ng ml(-1) (R2), 4 ng ml(-1) (R4), or 6 ng ml(-1) (R6) administered via TCI. RESULTS: The incidence of [pain] was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (12/32 and 6/31 vs 26/31 and 25/32, respectively, P<0.001). [Pain] was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (P<0.001). However, both incidence and severity of [pain] were not different between Groups R4 and R6.

 Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine induces [fetal pulmonary hypertension] in the rat. Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent [pulmonary hypertension syndrome] of the newborn. The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a [pulmonary hypertension] protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents. As compared with controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in [fetal pulmonary hypertension] as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01). Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals, and arterial [oxygen] saturation was 96 +/- 1% in 1-day-old control animals and significantly lower (P < 0.01) in fluoxetine-exposed pups (79 +/- 2%). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, fluoxetine exposure in utero induces [pulmonary hypertension] in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation.

 Erythropoietin restores the anemia-induced reduction in [cyclophosphamide] cytotoxicity in rat tumors. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of [cyclophosphamide] in solid experimental tumors. Four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (DS-[sarcoma] of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. When tumors were treated with a single dose of [cyclophosphamide] (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed. These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of [cyclophosphamide] in tumors, whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.

These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved [oxygen] supply to tumor tissue.

 Erythropoietin restores the anemia-induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat [tumors]. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental [tumors]. Anemia was induced using a single dose of [carboplatin] (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. In a second group, the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before [carboplatin] application. When [tumors] were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the [tumors] was observed.

 The role of nitrergic system in lidocaine-induced [convulsion] in the mouse. In the first experiment, four groups of mice received physiological saline (0.9%), [L-arginine] (300 mg/kg, i.p.), L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg), respectively.

 On Day 8, the nerve-evoked peak twitch tensions, tetanic tensions, and fatigability, and the dose-response curves of [d-tubocurarine] in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs. The 50% effective dose of [d-tubocurarine] (microg/kg) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P10 (33.6 +/- 5.4) than in the S (61.9 +/- 5.0) or the P100 (71.3 +/- 9.6) groups. The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass (r(2) = 0.32, P < 0.001), however, not with expression of AChR. The 50% effective dose of [d-tubocurarine] did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression. Our results suggest that the neuromuscular dysfunction after prednisolone is dose-dependent, and derives primarily from [muscle atrophy] and derives less so from changes in AChR expression.

Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not [rapamycin].

 [Nephrotoxicity] of cyclosporin A and FK506: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase. Cyclosporin A (CsA; 50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant [rapamycin] (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days. In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, but not by [rapamycin]. Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not [rapamycin]. These results suggest that the [nephrotoxic] effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.

 Anti-carcinogenic action of [phenobarbital] given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat.

The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of [phenobarbital] ([PB]: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN: 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + [PB] during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + [PB] treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of [PB] did not change significantly the last parameters. In DEN + [PB] treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone. It is concluded that [PB], which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN. This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the [precancerous lesions]. Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' [PB] effect.

 The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of [schizophrenia]. [Ketamine]-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). [Ketamine] elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and [ketamine] for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. [Ketamine] led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of [schizophrenia].

 The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin-induced [diabetic nephropathy]. OBJECTIVE: [Diabetic nephropathy] is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

RESULTS: The glomeruli of human [diabetic nephropathy] patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against [diabetic nephropathy] is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. In human renal mesangial cells, high [glucose] induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in [diabetic nephropathy], suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of [diabetic nephropathy].

In contrast, the [dexamethasone]-treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. The [dexamethasone]-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle [dexamethasone]-induced morphologic changes were evident. The [[dexamethasone]]-treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes, although several subtle [[dexamethasone]]-induced morphologic changes were evident. CONCLUSION: [Dexamethasone] treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30% of the dexamethasone-treated eyes. CONCLUSION: [Dexamethasone] treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30% of the [dexamethasone]-treated eyes. Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and [open angle glaucoma]. This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and [primary open angle glaucoma].

 Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and [hepatoma] of mice induced by alpha-benzene hexachloride. Peroxisomes in [hepatomas] and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process [hepatomas] appeared to have been formed. No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by [ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate] unlike in the case of rats.

 Quinidine [hepatitis]. Long-term administration of quinidine was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT, [lactic acid] dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase.

 To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, [gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid], tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity.

 Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and [daunorubicin] but not doxorubicin. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced [cardiotoxicity]. Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, [daunorubicin], and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, [daunorubicin], and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from [daunorubicin] and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of [daunorubicin] activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention.

RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of [[dexrazoxane]] reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, [[dexrazoxane]] neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that [dexrazoxane] reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of [dexrazoxane]. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining [dexrazoxane] and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity.

[Dexrazoxane-cardiac toxicity]
 Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not [doxorubicin]. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced [cardiotoxicity]. Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and [doxorubicin] +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and [doxorubicin], with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done.

 Protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, [BN 52021], on bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular impairments in rats. Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist [BN 52021] (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR. In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg [BN 52021] given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective. When [BN 52021] (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective. A partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with [BN 52021]. Since the administration of [BN 52021], at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of [BN 52021], a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity.

Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine-induced [cardiovascular alterations].

In addition, 90 minutes after CP injection, that is, at the time of administration of [morphine], the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination. [Morphine] dose-dependently reversed these behavioral disorders. At the time of administration of [morphine], histological modifications of the bladder wall, such as chorionic and muscle layer edema, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of CP-induced [cystitis] may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory visceral pain, allowing a better understanding of these painful syndromes and thus a better therapeutic approach to them.

 RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light-enhanced startle paradigm (LES) is suggested to model [anxiety], because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist [yohimbine] (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the GABA(A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS. RESULTS: None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and [yohimbine] increased absolute FPS values. Furthermore, [yohimbine] increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES, while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS.

There are no published [ASA] studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when [ASA] is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with [ASA] when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when [[ASA]] is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with [[ASA]] when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. METHODS: [ASA] was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats. RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and midline defects (MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia (DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though [ASA] induces several other low-incidence malformations. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and [hydrocephalus] in the Wistar rats. Variations and malformations were similar when [ASA] was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with [ASA] given at multiple doses.

In single dose studies, DH, [MD], and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10. In contrast, DH and [MD] were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups. Variations and malformations were similar when [ASA] was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with [ASA] given at multiple doses.

 Apomorphine: an underutilized therapy for [Parkinson's disease]. Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of [Parkinson's disease]. While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating [Parkinson's disease] by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study. A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with [levodopa] and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings. In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting [levodopa]-induced dyskinesias. Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating [Parkinson's disease], this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.

 PURPOSE: NGF and [PGs] in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with [OAB] and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with [OAB] compared with controls (p <0.05). However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with [OAB]. In patients with [OAB] urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with [OAB]. Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate [OAB] symptoms.

 Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with [overactive bladder]. We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with [OAB]. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with [OAB] and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. NGF, PGE2, PGF2alpha and [PGI2] were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups. In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG, and urodynamic parameters in patients with [OAB] were examined. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with [OAB] compared with controls (p <0.05). In patients with [OAB] urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of [OAB] symptoms in female patients. Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate [OAB] symptoms.

 The pathogenesis of this [myalgia] is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this [myalgia]. At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from [myalgia] (not significant).

 The mechanism by which this endogenous [steroid] enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the [amnesic]-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine-induced [amnesia]. Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced [amnesia]. These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive [steroids].

[Steroid-amnesic]
 Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-[amnesic] effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats. This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of [N-methyl-d-aspartate] receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the [amnesic]-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine-induced [amnesia]. The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine, suggesting that altering the modulation of [NMDA] receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of PREGS. Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced [amnesia].

 BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of [acute and chronic pain] in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation. The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and [capsaicin]-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal [capsaicin] injection were determined. RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal [capsaicin] injection for at least 24 h. In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral [capsaicin] injection.

 Effect of [lithium] maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function. OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by [lithium] maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations. These were evaluated with respect to the duration of [lithium] therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid disease). PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving [lithium] maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration. The control group consisted of 82 patients with no [psychiatric] or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital's out-patient clinics. OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning [lithium] therapy and at biannual follow-up. All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of [lithium] therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of [lithium] therapy). All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of [[lithium]] therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of [[lithium]] therapy). Magnesium levels in patients on [lithium] treatment were unchanged from baseline levels. After [lithium] treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels. Thus, [lithium] treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging. CONCLUSIONS: Familial thyroid illness is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia during [lithium] therapy.

 Treatment of [ifosfamide]-induced urothelial toxicity by oral administration of sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (MESNA) to patients with inoperable lung cancer. The protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate (MESNA) against urothelial toxicity induced by [ifosfamide] (IF) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with IF (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle.

MESNA was given orally on the days of treatment with [[IF]] in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of [[IF]]), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with [IF] were treated by conventional prophylactic measures (raised fluid intake and forced diuresis). In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and/or symptoms of bladder irritation (cystitis and [pollakisuria]). Our results support the view that MESNA, given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include [IF], simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium.

 In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose [alfentanil] anesthesia in the rat. Each rat was then injected with [alfentanil] (ALF, 0.5 mg/kg sc). Each rat was then injected with [alfentanil] ([ALF], 0.5 mg/kg sc). [ALF] injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. In contrast, D-MED prevented [alfentanil]-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion. The high-dose D-MED animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a [startle] response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

 The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of [ischemia] produced by MCAO. Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the [ischemic] territory). The extent of neuronal injury was determined by [2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium] staining. In the [ischemic] core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups. In the periphery of the [ischemic] territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05).

[Oxytocin] is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension, particularly when given as a bolus. Parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and [stroke] volume. [Oxytocin]-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss.

OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence and management of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with uveitis treated with the [fluocinolone acetonide] ([FA]) intravitreal implant. DESIGN: Pooled data from 3 multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0.59-mg or 2.1-mg [FA] intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed. The rate of [hypotony] (IOP </= 5 mm Hg) following IOP-lowering surgery (42.5%) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery (35.4%) (P = .09).

 A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of [Parkinson's disease] (PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985. A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of [Parkinson's disease] ([PD]) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985. Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant [PD], which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "on" symptoms of [PD], such as dyskinesias, as well as the "off" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations. Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving [levodopa]-induced dyskinesias.

 Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the [cardiotoxicity] of doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic. Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX-induced [cardiotoxicity]. Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor [PJ34], we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by DOX. Similar experiments were conducted in BALB/c mice treated with [PJ34] or vehicle. Treatment with a [PJ34] significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals.

 This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the tropicamide-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with [pilocarpine]. In another session, tropicamide (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of [pilocarpine] (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. The elderly group had a significantly greater [pilocarpine]-induced net decrease in pupil size 85, 125, 165 and 215 minutes after administration, compared with the young group (p < 0.05). Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced [impairment in word recall] 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to [pilocarpine] that is not found with tropicamide. Thus, [pilocarpine] may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients.

 Enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine-induced [hypertensive] rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation. Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of [norepinephrine] only. However, epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40% of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the [norepinephrine] content was reduced by a similar degree. Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both [norepinephrine] and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney.

[Phentolamine] increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine-treated group. Furthermore, data obtained with [phentolamine] alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment.
